== Description ==

= NextCellent Gallery Search =

This is just a fork of the NextGEN Gallery Search by Koen Schuit.
Not much is changed. Just all functions were renamed and updated to find the NextCellent plugin.

NextCellent Gallery - Search Galleries adds a search option to the existing NextCellent Gallery menu.

With this option you can search through your galleries quick and easy, you don’t have to go through a whole list of galleries anymore.
The output of the search will be shown in a table similar to the manage galleries page and will provide a link to that gallery.

NextCellent Gallery Search even adds an option to search in the description which can be helpful if you don’t remember the name.

And NextCellent Gallery Search also has the ability to search for a part of the name or description. 
For example: **int** will find **int**ernet, but also w**int**er, ballpo**int**, sa**int**s etc.

Please note: this plugin requires NextCellent Gallery - NextGEN Legacy installed.
